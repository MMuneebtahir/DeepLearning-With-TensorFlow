### Introduction to Tensors
* Creating a Tensor with `tf.Variable`
* Random Tensor are tensors of some arbitrary size that contain random number 
* Shuffling the order of Elements in tensors
* Turn Numpy to Tensors
     The main difference between Numpy arrays and tensors is that tensors cannot can be run on a GPU (much faster for numerical computing)

* Getting Information from Tensors

** When dealing with tensors you probably to be aware of following attribute :
* Shape
* Rank
* Axsis
* Size


** Indexing Tensors
   tensor can be indexed like python list



* Manipulating Tensors (tensor operations)
**Basic Operation**
